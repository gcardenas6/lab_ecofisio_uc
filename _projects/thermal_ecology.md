## Overview

Our research focuses on thermal ecology and evolutionary physiology, addressing how ectothermic organisms respond to variations in their thermal environment. We use a combination of experimental studies and theoretical models to analyze physiological and behavioral responses to temperature in different species, including terrestrial and aquatic organisms.

## Overview

In parallel, we work with community ecology, analyzing how their functional composition and interaction networks vary. Currently, we are developing analytical methods to study the structure of complex networks and attempt to project how global warming will affect trophic and pollination ecological networks around the world. In collaboration with international research groups, we are analyzing how projected temperatures for 2100 will affect pollination networks in Europe. In the future, we intend to expand these analyses to systems on other continents, including South America, which would involve describing new empirical networks in Chile in collaboration with other research groups and students.

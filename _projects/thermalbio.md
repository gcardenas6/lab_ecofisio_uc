## Overview

One of the great unknowns of our time is how different organisms will respond to climate change. With our collaborators, we have developed new approaches to estimate the thermotolerance range of different lineages, and we are currently focused on developing mechanistic models that allow us to predict, based on physiological traits and life history estimated in the laboratory, the resilience of different lineages to environmental change and their potential distribution in future scenarios.

## Overview

Phenotypic traits do not evolve independently, whether due to functional constraints or genetic factors, which limits the number of possible evolutionary responses to selective pressures. In our laboratory, we study how different lineages respond to different selective pressures and how integrated phenotypes emerge in response to natural selection. To do this, we have used empirical and comparative approaches and have studied a wide variety of organisms, including insects, fish, amphibians, birds, mammals, and even dinosaurs.
